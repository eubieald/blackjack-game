# Basic HTML, CSS and JS Blackjack Example Project

### The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it. A hand with a total value over 21 results in a bust and a loss.


This project is an example that was built along with a Youtube series showing how to create a basic HTML, CSS and JS project. Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:

* arrays
* objects
* booleans
* if else statements
* comparison operators
* logical operators
* for loops
* The Math object
* return statements

## How to tweak this project for your own use:

I would recommend you to clone and rename this project so that you can use it for your own needs as it is an example project. This boilerplate is a nice place to start.
